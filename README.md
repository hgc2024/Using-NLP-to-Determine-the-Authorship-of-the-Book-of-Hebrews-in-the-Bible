# Using-NLP-to-Determine-the-Authorship-of-the-Book-of-Hebrews-in-the-Bible

This repository contains a framework for using Natural Language Processing on the KJV Bible. The original corpus contains the entire KJV Bible retrieved from Project Gutenberg.

Goal: The goal of this project is to use NLP methods on the original KJV Bible to determine the authorship of the book of Hebrews, which is currently unknown. Various models will be utilised ranging from Bag of Words to Google’s BERT model. 

Specification: Python will be used as the main software, as Python is well-suited for NLP. The models use will vary widely in terms of their complexity, with all the models trained to determine the question of the authorship of Hebrews.
